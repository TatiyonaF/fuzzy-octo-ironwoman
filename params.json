This is a project that gets you going after hearing you favorite song after having a bad day. It is programed by arduino and you can only modify it by using the right arduino coding. \r\n\r\n**Parts:**\r\n* \tAn arduino uno and the shield that is attached to it\r\n* \t8GB SD card and card holder\r\n* \tReed switches\r\n* \tSpeakers\r\n* \tAdaptor\r\n* \tA-to-B USB cord\r\n* \tParts that came with the arduino shield\r\n* \tI added a LED light so I can know that the music is playing\r\n* \tI also added some wires to hook up to the reed switches so I can have more space between the door and device.\r\n\r\n**How it works:**\r\nWhen you have all of you parts in place and have everything working you have to put music on the SD card. When you put the music on the card make sure it is in .WAV form. When you have your music ready and in the right form, place your reed switches on a door close together. When you open the door the music will automatically play. If you are using the generic arduino code the music will keep playing when you close the door. If you want the music to stop there is another code.\r\n\r\n**References:**\r\nhttp://ladyada.net/make/waveshield/\r\n","tagline":"This device has the ability to play music when you open a door."}
